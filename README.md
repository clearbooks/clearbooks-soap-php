PHP Wrapper for the ClearBooks SOAP API
=======================================

You can use this set of classed to access the ClearBooks SOAP API. I didn't really do much here, just re-packaged it to work with composer and pushed it up to packagist.

You can install with composer:

    composer install antz29/clearbooks-soap-php
    
See the demo dir for usage examples.
